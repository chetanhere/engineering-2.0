## Summary
Hyperledger Fabric platform is an open source Blockchain framework hosted by The Linux Foundation which now comes under Hyperledger umbrella. It is based on Distributed Ledger Technology platform. Permissioned Fabric networks are permissioned, meaning all participating member's identities are known and authenticated.

Fabric acts as a foundation for developing Blockchain-based products, solutions, and applications using plug-and-play components that are aimed for use within private enterprises.

Current curriculum you are seeing is five days BootCamp. This curriculum is helpful for the students who want to aim for Blockchain Developer and want to get entry in Product Based Companies. Please keep revisiting the link, we shall also update the change log for any changes/modifications in the curriculum content.

## Prerequisites:
- Willingness to learn and to go extra mile (this course need dedicated 4 hours a day for 5 days).
- Practical programming is required. Should have one basic configuration laptop/PC or should have access on Laboratory/Library computers.
- Basic level knowledge of Programming Concepts and programming experience of at least one programming language (Java, Golang, Nodejs).
- Linux system understanding, if local desktop doesnâ€™t support HLF setup. (Virtualbox can be preferred)
- Basic understanding of Linux commands.
- AWS EC2 understanding is optional.

This curriculum is a collection of YouTube Videos, Medium Articles, 101Blockchain Articles, Code Practices and Official documentation. Please follow it as per your ease. Students takes months for being comfortable with the environment. There is no such rule on time, please follow your own speed.

Taking extra time is no problem!

**Organization**: The curriculum is designed as follows:
- _Blockchain Basics_: Student will learn about basics of Blockchain Technology and understand about Distributed Ledger Technology. It will be helpful in getting real implementations knowledge.
- _Fabric Overview_: In this section Student will get to learn about the Fabric basics and Prerequisites of Fabric, Architecture and some dependencies.
- _Fabric Network Setup_: In this section Student will learn in depth about Fabric Orderer, Peer etc. 
- _Chaincode Lifecycle_: This section will give depth knowledge of 4 step chaincode lifecycle which includes package, install, approve and commit.
- _REST APIs_: This section gives introduction to Fabric SDK and connection of Fabric to chaincode. 
Duration: It is possible to complete basic level of understanding in 5 days.

## Cost:
Nearly all content is free of cost, still you may need to purchase few courses if you want to understand more Blockchain in depth. Don't worry for Certificates, I have attached some free certifications with the Boot Camp, which can be shared in professional profile and LinkedIn.

## Process:
- We recommend to follow curriculum step by step.
- Complete the mentioned exercise post every day lecture.
- Build small POC projects/GitHub repository and share them with your friends/world.
- If you have some good resources, then please comment them and we shall consider to add them too.
- Keep practicing shell scripts.

## Content Policy:
Don't share the solution files publicly until mentioned specifically. Help fellow learners but don't help in copying. Copying will break this good system, we need your support in keeping it clean.
Community
- Join us on Discord Chat with fellow developers.
- Join us on Telegram channel to follow announcements.
- Subscribe email list and get updates on your email.
- Be respectful while asking your doubts and share maximum information about what challenge you are facing.
- Add EduPass to your LinkedIn profile School section, it will help you in finding fellow learners.
